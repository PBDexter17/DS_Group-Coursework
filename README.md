## Description
New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.<br>


In this competition, the goal is to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking. There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country and the datasets consist of a list of users with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics.

## Data
Please download the data file from the drop box (Github limits the upload file size) from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/l/AACPeP_iUS0U75-uJPJEXfZln-aOAYhHji8)<br>
After download the data, please decompress the data file and put it under the pythonKaggle directory.(e.g. pythonKaggle/data)
